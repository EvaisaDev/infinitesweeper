Sometimes the camera fucking flies off into the distance for no apparent reason.
People randomly die when clicking what should have been a save point, either something is fucking spawning bombs on top of other players or they have skill issue.
Server lags like shit if theres more than like 10 people.
Players sometimes spawn inside of eachother somehow, i tried to fix this several times and it still keeps happening. no idea if it is fixed at this point.
Chording sometimes puts down wrong flags??? or bombs change without the numbers changing? i don't fucking know anyway people should realistically not be able to die when chording unless they manually put flags down.
I think shit breaks if people disconnect in the middle of dying?
If someone large dies it probably freezes the server.
I wish the server wouldn't crash when i spawn 50 bots for shits and giggles lmao
